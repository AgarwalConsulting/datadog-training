---

### Some tips

- Slow down => stop & think
  - listen for the questions and answer

- Do the exercises
  - not add-ons; not optional

- There are no dumb questions!

- Drink water. Lots of it!

---

### Some tips (continued)

## What is monitoring?

---
class: center, middle

Monitoring is a process of observing and tracking activities and progress.

---
class: center, middle

Monitoring of a program or intervention involves the collection of routine data that measure progress toward achieving program objectives.

---
class: center, middle

### Types of Monitoring

---

- *Process Monitoring*

  Process monitoring can ensure that you're executing project activities.

- *Availability Monitoring*

  Availability monitoring is the simplest way for network teams to know if a device is up and operational.

- *Security Monitoring*

  Security attacks and network infringements impact the flow of data traffic and network behavior.

---

- *Compliance Monitoring*

  Just as the name suggests, the purpose of compliance monitoring is to ensure compliance with donor regulations, grant, contract requirements, local governmental regulations and laws, ethical standards, and most importantly compliance with the expected results of the project.

- *Cloud/Infrastructure Monitoring*

  This involves tracking and analyzing the health, performance, and usage of cloud-based resources and services to ensure efficiency and reliability.

## Observability and SRE

---
class: center, middle

Observability is the ability to measure the internal states of a system by examining its outputs.

---
class: center, middle

A system is considered ‚Äúobservable‚Äù if the current state can be estimated by only using information from outputs, namely sensor data.

---
class: center, middle

### Monitoring vs Observability

---
class: center, middle

Where monitoring is an action you take, observability is an overall function or property of a system.

---
class: center, middle

The more you can observe a system, the more you can understand it's complex ways.

---

Monitoring is an action you take. Monitoring a system, an app, a certain metric to pick up on anomalies that might indicate an issue. It answers the question ‚ÄúIs this system working correctly?‚Äù

Observability is a property of your system, not an action, that helps you control complexity. It answers the question: ‚ÄúWhat is happening inside this app or across a system?‚Äù While observability incorporates monitoring activities, it goes far beyond mere monitoring.

---
class: center, middle

Telemetry is simply the supporting pillars.

---

- Logging provides insight into application-specific messages emitted by processes.

- Metrics provide quantitative information about processes running inside the system, including counters, gauges, and histograms.

- Tracing, aka distributed tracing, provides insight into the full lifecycles, aka traces, of requests to the system, allowing you to pinpoint failures and performance issues.

---
class: center, middle

Logs, metrics and traces are what power observability but these three items on their own do not make a system observable.

---
class: center, middle

### Challenges with legacy monitoring

---
class: center, middle

#### Data gaps

---
class: center, middle

Traditional monitoring tools might only sample data, limiting the full visibility for both the users and any analytics algorithms running on that data. The result is lower visibility into customer-impacting issues, which translates to longer time to resolving the issue.

---

class: center, middle

#### Slow movement

---
class: center, middle

Serverless functions inherent in cloud-native tech are invoked within seconds or less. Traditional monitoring tools can‚Äôt pick up action this quickly, contributing to more missing data.

---
class: center, middle

#### Missing intelligence

---
class: center, middle

Most monitoring tools weren‚Äôt built to take in the rate of data we‚Äôre accustomed to today. What data they do take in, the tools aren‚Äôt equipped with built-in intel, resulting in too many alerts and not enough actionable insight.

---
class: center, middle

#### Tool sprawl

---
class: center, middle

Monitoring can apply to practically any digital area‚Äîwhich means there are too many tools to overlay and integrate. This is another missed opportunity.

---
class: center, middle

## As a SRE...

.content-credits[https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/sre-fundamentals-slis-slas-and-slos]

---
class: center, middle

The concept of SRE starts with the idea that metrics should be closely tied to business objectives. We use several essential tools‚ÄîSLO, SLA and SLI‚Äîin SRE planning and practice.

---
class: center, middle

### Service-Level Objective (SLO)

---
class: center, middle

Availability, in SRE terms, defines whether a system is able to fulfill its intended function at a point in time.

---
class: center, middle

The historical availability measurement can also describe the probability that your system will perform as expected in the future.

---
class: center, middle

We term this target the availability Service-Level Objective (SLO) of our system.

---
class: center, middle

### Service-Level Agreement (SLA)

---
class: center, middle

An SLA normally involves a promise to someone using your service that its availability SLO should meet a certain level over a certain period, and if it fails to do so then some kind of penalty will be paid.

---
class: center, middle

The concept is that going out of SLO is going to hurt the service team, so they will push hard to stay within SLO.

---
class: center, middle

Because of this, and because of the principle that availability shouldn‚Äôt be much better than the SLO, the availability SLO in the SLA is normally a looser objective than the internal availability SLO.

---
class: center, middle

If you have an SLO in your SLA that is different from your internal SLO, as it almost always is, it‚Äôs important for your monitoring to measure SLO compliance explicitly.

---
class: center, middle

### Service-Level Indicator (SLI)

---
class: center, middle

the frequency of successful probes of our system

---
class: center, middle

When we evaluate whether our system has been running within SLO for the past week, we look at the SLI to get the service availability percentage.

---
class: center, middle

If you‚Äôre building a system from scratch, make sure that SLIs and SLOs are part of your system requirements. If you already have a production system but don‚Äôt have them clearly defined, then that‚Äôs your highest priority work.
