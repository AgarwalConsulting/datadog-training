## What is monitoring?

---
class: center, middle

Monitoring is a process of observing and tracking activities and progress.

---
class: center, middle

Monitoring of a program or intervention involves the collection of routine data that measure progress toward achieving program objectives.

---
class: center, middle

### Types of Monitoring

---

- *Process Monitoring*

  Process monitoring can ensure that you're executing project activities.

- *Availability Monitoring*

  Availability monitoring is the simplest way for network teams to know if a device is up and operational.

- *Security Monitoring*

  Security attacks and network infringements impact the flow of data traffic and network behavior.

---

- *Compliance Monitoring*

  Just as the name suggests, the purpose of compliance monitoring is to ensure compliance with donor regulations, grant, contract requirements, local governmental regulations and laws, ethical standards, and most importantly compliance with the expected results of the project.

- *Cloud/Infrastructure Monitoring*

  This involves tracking and analyzing the health, performance, and usage of cloud-based resources and services to ensure efficiency and reliability.

## Observability and SRE

---
class: center, middle

Observability is the ability to measure the internal states of a system by examining its outputs.

---
class: center, middle

A system is considered ‚Äúobservable‚Äù if the current state can be estimated by only using information from outputs, namely sensor data.

---
class: center, middle

### Monitoring vs Observability

---
class: center, middle

Where monitoring is an action you take, observability is an overall function or property of a system.

---
class: center, middle

The more you can observe a system, the more you can understand it's complex ways.

---
class: center, middle

Monitoring is an action you take. Monitoring a system, an app, a certain metric to pick up on anomalies that might indicate an issue. It answers the question "Is this system working correctly?"

.content-credits[https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/observability-vs-monitoring-vs-telemetry.html]

---
class: center, middle

Observability is a property of your system, not an action, that helps you control complexity. It answers the question: ‚ÄúWhat is happening inside this app or across a system?‚Äù While observability incorporates monitoring activities, it goes far beyond mere monitoring.

.content-credits[https://www.splunk.com/en_us/blog/learn/observability-vs-monitoring-vs-telemetry.html]

---
class: center, middle

Telemetry is simply the supporting pillars.

---

- Logging provides insight into application-specific messages emitted by processes.

- Metrics provide quantitative information about processes running inside the system, including counters, gauges, and histograms.

- Tracing, aka distributed tracing, provides insight into the full lifecycles, aka traces, of requests to the system, allowing you to pinpoint failures and performance issues.

---
class: center, middle

Logs, metrics and traces are what power observability but these three items on their own do not make a system observable.

---
class: center, middle

### Challenges with legacy monitoring

---
class: center, middle

#### Data gaps

---
class: center, middle

Traditional monitoring tools might only sample data, limiting the full visibility for both the users and any analytics algorithms running on that data. The result is lower visibility into customer-impacting issues, which translates to longer time to resolving the issue.

---

class: center, middle

#### Slow movement

---
class: center, middle

Serverless functions inherent in cloud-native tech are invoked within seconds or less. Traditional monitoring tools can‚Äôt pick up action this quickly, contributing to more missing data.

---
class: center, middle

#### Missing intelligence

---
class: center, middle

Most monitoring tools weren‚Äôt built to take in the rate of data we‚Äôre accustomed to today. What data they do take in, the tools aren‚Äôt equipped with built-in intel, resulting in too many alerts and not enough actionable insight.

---
class: center, middle

#### Tool sprawl

---
class: center, middle

Monitoring can apply to practically any digital area‚Äîwhich means there are too many tools to overlay and integrate. This is another missed opportunity.

---
class: center, middle

## As a SRE...

.content-credits[https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/devops-sre/sre-fundamentals-slis-slas-and-slos]

---
class: center, middle

The concept of SRE starts with the idea that metrics should be closely tied to business objectives.

---
class: center, middle

We use several essential tools‚ÄîSLO, SLA and SLI‚Äîin SRE planning and practice.

---
class: center, middle

### Service-Level Objective (SLO)

---
class: center, middle

Availability, in SRE terms, defines whether a system is able to fulfill its intended function at a point in time.

---
class: center, middle

The historical availability measurement can also describe the probability that your system will perform as expected in the future.

---
class: center, middle

We term this target the availability Service-Level Objective (SLO) of our system.

---
class: center, middle

### Service-Level Agreement (SLA)

---
class: center, middle

An SLA normally involves a promise to someone using your service that its availability SLO should meet a certain level over a certain period, and if it fails to do so then some kind of penalty will be paid.

---
class: center, middle

The concept is that going out of SLO is going to hurt the service team, so they will push hard to stay within SLO.

---
class: center, middle

Because of this, and because of the principle that availability shouldn‚Äôt be much better than the SLO, the availability SLO in the SLA is normally a looser objective than the internal availability SLO.

---
class: center, middle

If you have an SLO in your SLA that is different from your internal SLO, as it almost always is, it‚Äôs important for your monitoring to measure SLO compliance explicitly.

---
class: center, middle

### Service-Level Indicator (SLI)

---
class: center, middle

the frequency of successful probes of our system

---
class: center, middle

When we evaluate whether our system has been running within SLO for the past week, we look at the SLI to get the service availability percentage.

---
class: center, middle

If you‚Äôre building a system from scratch, make sure that SLIs and SLOs are part of your system requirements. If you already have a production system but don‚Äôt have them clearly defined, then that‚Äôs your highest priority work.

class: center, middle

## DataDog Capabilities

---
class: center, middle

DataDog provides **real-time observability** for applications running on **on-prem, cloud, containers, and Kubernetes** environments.

---
class: center, middle

### **1. Infrastructure Monitoring**

---
class: center, middle

Supports **EKS (Managed)** and **Self-managed Kubernetes**

---
class: center, middle

üìå **Why It Matters**: Kubernetes environments are complex, and visibility into **pods, nodes, workloads, and networking** is essential for performance tuning and troubleshooting.

---

- **Auto-discovery** of Kubernetes workloads, services, and containers.

- **Node & Pod Metrics**: CPU, memory, disk, network usage.

- **Event Monitoring**: Track restarts, crash loops, deployments, and errors.

- **Cluster Maps**: Visualize your cluster in real time (health, deployments, and resource allocation).

- **Kubernetes Logs**: Ingest logs from pods and correlate with traces & metrics.

---

üîπ **How It Works**:

- Deploy the **DataDog Agent as a DaemonSet** in your cluster.

- Enable **Kubernetes State Metrics** and **Autodiscovery** for monitoring services dynamically.

- Use **Live Containers** view for real-time container metrics.

---
class: center, middle

*Example Use Case*: Monitor a Java-based microservice running on Kubernetes, correlating pod crashes with **OOM (Out of Memory) errors** and slow response times.

---
class: center, middle

Supports **Bare Metal & EC2 Monitoring**

---
class: center, middle

üìå **Why It Matters**: Unlike cloud-managed services, **bare metal and EC2 instances** require **direct agent-based monitoring** for OS-level visibility.

---

- System health metrics (**CPU, memory, disk I/O, network**).

- Custom **process monitoring** (e.g., JVM, database, background jobs).

- **Disk utilization monitoring** (avoid failures due to low disk space).

- **Custom scripts & integrations** (for services running on bare metal).

- Custom dashboards for hybrid environments.

---

üîπ **How It Works**:

- Install **DataDog Agent** directly on bare metal or EC2 instances.

- Use **system checks** for resource utilization monitoring.

- Enable **log collection** for applications running on physical/virtual machines.

---
class: center, middle

*Example Use Case*: Track CPU spikes on a **bare-metal server running ElasticSearch**, correlating high CPU usage with expensive query patterns.

---
class: center, middle

### **2. Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**

---
class: center, middle

**Java Monitoring** (Spring Boot, Micronaut, Quarkus, etc.)

---
class: center, middle

üìå **Why It Matters**: Performance bottlenecks in **Spring Boot, Micronaut, Quarkus**, or other Java applications can be hard to diagnose without **tracing, profiling, and real-time insights**.

---

- **Distributed Tracing**: Trace requests across microservices.

- **Automatic Instrumentation**: Works out-of-the-box for Java (Spring Boot, Hibernate, JDBC, etc.).

- **Profiling & Flame Graphs**: Detect CPU/memory-heavy functions.

- **Service Maps**: Visual representation of how services interact.

- **Error Tracking**: Detect **slow queries, timeouts, and exceptions**.

- Code-level visibility into request performance.

- Automatic instrumentation for Java applications.

---

üîπ **How It Works**:

- Add the **DataDog Java APM Agent** to your application (`dd-java-agent.jar`).

- Configure `DD_SERVICE`, `DD_ENV`, and `DD_VERSION` for environment tagging.

- Enable **JVM metrics** (GC pauses, heap memory, thread states).

- Use **tracing without code changes** (auto-instrumentation for HTTP, database, messaging).

---
class: center, middle

*Example Use Case*: A **Spring Boot microservice** experiences intermittent slow response times. APM traces reveal that a **specific SQL query is taking 3s**, causing a performance bottleneck. Database query optimization reduces response time by 80%.

---
class: center, middle

**Database Monitoring** (AWS SQL Server on RDS)

---
class: center, middle

üìå **Why It Matters**: Database performance issues can cause **slow APIs, increased latencies, and application crashes**.

---

- Supports **AWS RDS (SQL Server)** with query performance insights.

- Query performance insights (**slow queries, deadlocks, missing indexes**).

- **Connections & Locks Monitoring**: Track open connections, transaction locks.

- **Query Execution Plans**: Analyze how SQL queries execute.

- **Replication & Backup Monitoring**: Ensure database replication works as expected.

---

üîπ **How It Works**:

- Enable **RDS Enhanced Monitoring** in AWS.

- Connect DataDog with **AWS Integration** for automatic ingestion of RDS metrics.

- Use **Query Performance Monitoring (QPM)** to track execution times.

---
class: center, middle

*Example Use Case*: A **Java-based API running on Kubernetes** is slow when querying SQL Server. DataDog detects that a **missing index** is causing a **full table scan** on a large table. Adding the index **reduces query execution time from 2.5s to 200ms**.

---
class: center, middle

### **3. Log Management**

---
class: center, middle

üìå **Why It Matters**: Centralized logging helps **correlate infrastructure, application, and security logs** for debugging and threat detection.

---

- **Live Tail Logs**: Real-time logging from Kubernetes, EC2, and Java apps.

- **Log Correlation with Traces**: See logs in the context of APM traces and metrics for debugging.

- Aggregates logs from **ElasticSearch** and Kubernetes.

---

üîπ **How It Works**:

- Configure **DataDog Log Forwarders** for AWS, Kubernetes, and on-prem logs.

- Use **Regex & pattern-based alerts** for error detection.

- Integrate with **SIEM (Security Information and Event Management)** solutions for security logs.

---
class: center, middle

### **4. Security & Compliance**

---

- **Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)** for AWS compliance.

- **Container security**: Monitors vulnerabilities in running containers.

- **Threat detection** for unauthorized access patterns.

- **Security Threat Detection**: Detect unauthorized access & anomalies.

- **SIEM Capabilities**: Centralized **threat intelligence & compliance monitoring**.

---
class: center, middle

*Example Use Case*: An **unauthorized API access attempt** is detected on AWS. DataDog logs show repeated **failed login attempts from an unknown IP**. Security team blocks the IP and updates IAM policies.

---
class: center, middle

#### **5. Custom Dashboards & Alerts**

---
class: center, middle

üìå **Why It Matters**: Custom dashboards provide **real-time visualization** of your entire stack.

---

- Drag-and-drop **custom dashboards**.

- **Alerting on Anomalies**: Detect unusual spikes in latency or error rates.

- **Multi-cloud & Hybrid Monitoring**: AWS, Kubernetes, and on-prem metrics in one place.

- **Integration with Slack, PagerDuty, and Webhooks**.

---
class: center, middle

*Example Use Case*: A **Java microservice on Kubernetes** starts throwing `500 errors`. DataDog detects a **correlation between high CPU usage and slow DB queries**. The team **auto-scales pods to handle increased traffic**.

---
class: center, middle

*In Short*: With DataDog, you get a **full-stack observability solution** covering **infrastructure, APM, logs, security, and databases**.
